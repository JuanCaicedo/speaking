# Test-driven CSS

Your styles should be as high quality as all your other code. You should be able
to easily make changes without introducing regressions, enabling your codebase
to grow with ease. Automated testing and test-driven development facilitate this
for front-end and back-end code, but why not also do it for your CSS?

This workshop will introduce developers to Quixote, a Javascript library for
automated CSS testing. It will address both traditional stylesheets and
different versions of CSS-in-JS. Developers will learn how to apply Test Driven
Development techniques to the process of implementing designs as well as how to
introduce CSS testing to an existing code base.
