# Building for the Node-Unix interface

Imagine being able to build simple scripts that can interact easily with any
Unix commands and compose together to make complex applications. Not only is
that possible with Node.js, it's easy! Node provides easy access to everything
you need to create powerful system-level utilities, and following the Unix
philosophy of modularity and reusability enables developers to write
incredibly powerful and flexible command line applications. This talk will
introduce the concepts of Unix command pipelines, input and output stream
handling in Node.js, and effective API design for Node scripts. By the end,
developers will know how to begin writing custom scripts that hook up to any
other Unix utilities.
