# The Node-Unix interface

Imagine being able to build scripts that can fit into any pipeline of Unix
commands at any place. Not only is that possible with Node.js, it's easy! Node
provides easy access to everything you need to create powerful system level
utilities, and following the Unix philosophy of modularity and reusability
enables developers to write incredibly powerful and flexible command line
applications. This talk will introduce the concepts of Unix command pipelines,
input and output stream handling in Node.js, and effective API design for Node
scripts. By the end, developers will be able to write custom scripts that hook
up to any other Unix utilities.
