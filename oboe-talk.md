## A better AJAX, loading large JSON easily

Working with large JSON documents in a web app can be slow and cumbersome. But that is no reason to let your user experience suffer! By bringing event-driven JSON parsing to your REST data transfer, it is posible to write applications that handle large documents just as easily as small ones. This new way of looking at AJAX makes it possible to handle dropped connections with grace, step outside the trade-off between big and small JSON, and convert any API to a mobile-friendly data source. Doing so enables faster and more reliable web apps, all while making user happier. In this talk, developers will learn how to implement Oboe.js, an incremental JSON loading library, in their client and server-side code as well as the practical applications for doing so.
