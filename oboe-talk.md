## AJAX++ with Event-Driven JSON loading

Working with large JSON documents in a web app can be slow and cumbersome. Don't let your UX or performance suffer! Instead bring the event driven nature of SAX to your REST data transfer, using Oboe.js. This new way of looking at AJAX makes it possible to handle dropped connections with grace, step outside the trade-off between big and small JSON, and convert any API to a mobile-friendly data source. Doing so enables faster and more reliable web apps, and increases user happiness. By the end of this talk, developers will know how to implement Oboe.js in their client and server-side code and the practical applications for doing so.
