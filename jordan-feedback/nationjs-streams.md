# Nation JS Node Day, better JSON through streams

## My own feedback

- Sort of 2
- And 9
- So 25
- Alright 1
- Plop too colloquial, 4
- Rehearse more so that phrases make more sense
- Review Amazon example and make it more significant
- Review motivation points for highland
- Be more prepared in difficulties slide
- Coupled server responses was good tonality
- Illustrations would be nice
- Review wording of the multiple AJAX situation
- Show application at the beginning or at the end?
- Multiple browsers or windows to switch between pages
- Slide Data slide talks about huge response, so I can wait to mention it until
that bullet point
- Show JSON data
- One request good excitement
  * Bring that excitement to the whole solution
- Links for highland and oboe at the end
- Stuck behind podium when slides became shorter (code)
- Good explanation of oboe internal mechanism
- Explain oboe pattern more
- Bigger text on slides?
- Why split on characters?
- Images would make for better illustrations
- Point out that map is a highland function, not an array function
- Don't forget highland call to sequential()!
- Add slide with one stream from module at the end of step 2
- Explain order of operations for merge better
- Stream of strings vs stream of objects
- Explain preference for breaking into many small working steps
- Be sure
- Good review of code as we finish them
- Explain network down better, it's cool!
- Avoid typing
- "What did you tell them?"
- Stronger finish

## Jordan's feedback

- Make checklist
  * Go through slides for transitions
