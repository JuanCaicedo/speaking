## Building Command Line Applications, the Node Way

A program becomes much more powerful when it evolves from a simple script to a
full-blown command line application. How to build a good CLA is a skill that
every Node developer should have. However, interacting with your logic through a
command prompt is very different from doing it on the web, and it takes
deliberate thought and consideration to do it well. In this talk, I'll share my
experience developing and open-sourcing a tool that enables publishers to better
interact Google's DFP API. We will cover techniques that facilitate making apps
more interactive and robust. Developers will learn how to leverage their skills
and knowledge from web development to towards creating reusable and
distributable CLA's.
