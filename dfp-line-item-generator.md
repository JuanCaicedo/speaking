## Building Command Line Applications, the Node Way

Programs become much more powerful when they evolve from a simple script to a full-blown command line application. How to build a good CLA is a skill that every Node developer should have. Yet, interacting with your logic through a command prompt is very different from doing it on the web, and it takes deliberate thought and consideration to do it well. In this talk, I'll share my experience developing and open-sourcing a tool that enables publishers to better interact Google's DFP API. We will cover techniques that facilitate making apps more interactive and robust. Developers will learn how to leverage their skills and knowledge from web development to towards creating reusable and distributable CLA's.
