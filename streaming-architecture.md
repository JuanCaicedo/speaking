## Better JSON through streams
One of the best features of Node is being able to use UNIX-like data streams. However, knowing how to leverage them in your web application can be daunting! Doing so successfuly though leads to much more efficient applications that scale to handling large amounts of data effortlessly. This talk will introduce an architechture that uses streaming as it's main means of communication. It will explore three frontiers of streaming: how to stream from module to module in the back end, sending a stream response from the server to the client, receiving and processing a stream response on the client. By the end, developers will learn the basics of UNIX streams, how to use them with Node.js scripts, and how to write web applications that profit from all the benefits of streams.
