## Better JSON through streams

One of the best features of Node is UNIX-like data streams, but knowing how to integrate leverage them in your web application can be daunting! This talk will explore three frontiers of streaming: 
  
  - Streaming from module to module in the back end.
  - Sending a stream response from the server to the client.
  - Receiving and processing a stream response on the client.

This architecture lead to much more efficient applications that scale to handling large amounts of data effortlessly. By the end, developers will learn the basics of UNIX streams, how to use them with Node.js scripts, and how to write web applications that use streams as their main means of communication.
