# Building Command Line Applications, the Node way

A program becomes much more powerful when it evolves from a simple script to a
full-blown command line application. How to build a good CLA is a skill that
every Node developer should have. However, interacting with your logic through a
command prompt is very different from doing it on the web, and it takes
deliberate thought and consideration to do it well. In this talk, I'll share
what I've learned about creating reusable command line tools from my
professional and open source work. Developers will learn how to leverage their
skills and knowledge from web development to towards creating reusable and
distributable CLA's.
