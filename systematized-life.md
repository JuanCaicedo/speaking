# Systematized approaches to everyday life

Life is complex, full of uncertainty, and constantly changing. Does that sound
like software engineering? This talk will explore how we can use the methods
commonly applied in programming to other situations in real life, from packing a
bag to having difficult conversations. By examining areas other than
programming, well look at how pre-designed systems can help save mental
bandwidth and make it easier to adapt to the unexpected. By the end, developers
will be able to use these ideas to better create and evaluate software systems.
