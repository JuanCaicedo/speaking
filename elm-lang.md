## Elm, Functional Front-end Programming

A language need only have four things. A strict, yet friendly compiler. A smooth
refactoring experience. Easy to reason about code. Blazing-fast HTML. Did I
mention you don't have to worry about off by one errors? Elm is a modern
transpile to javascript language that makes front-end productive and
maintainable. In this talk, we'll build an Elm application together that
demonstrates the benefits of immutable state, strong typing, and
a functional-reactive paradigm. By the end, developers will be able to build
a simple Elm web-app and the next steps for expanding it.
