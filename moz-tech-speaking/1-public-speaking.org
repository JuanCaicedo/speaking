* Choosing a topic on which to speak
** Info
Based on your tech/non-tech expertise, select a topic to present at a
conference. (Examples: Rust Language, Mixed Reality, Tech Diversity, Open
Communities.)
** Answer
Mixed reality
* Contemplate your personal style
** Info
Think for a while and write down your own creative strategy to hold your
audienceâ€™s attention.
- Example: Will you talk about code, share a personal story, or offer a unique
  perspective on a common experience? Tell us about your planned approach.
** Answer
- Show visualizations
- Show code snippets instead of getting into every single code example
- Use example projects that they find relevant
* Contemplate your potential audience and delivery:
** Info
- Will you be presenting this material as a talk or as a workshop?; Are you
  targeting an audience of 20 or 200? Will you be presenting to beginners or
  experienced coders?
- Tell us about your goals and consider how factors like audience size and
  experience may impact the best way to deliver your content.
** Answer
- Around 500 people (JSConf)
- Mixed levels in JS (average is 50% beginners)
- Beginners in VR
- Given that few people will have experience in VR, it will be useful to explain
  a lot of the concepts that are guiding my approach and design (psychology,
  architecture, etc)
- For beginning coders, my hope is that the visualizations will be clearer in
  structure than the code they are describing
- There might not be much time to explore the demos in depth, so it might be a
  good idea to identify interesting examples and showcase them
* Prepare for helpful and actionable feedback
** Info
List out 5 questions (based on your talk presentation) that you would like to
ask your audience for feedback on.

Example of possible questions below:
- Were there any terms or technologies from this presentation that you were
  hearing/learning-about for the first time?
- Demo : Anyone worked on the same Idea before? If yes - How is it different
  from yours?
- Do you feel that the presentation deck used helped to support the content and
  message that I delivered?
- Do you have any suggestions for live code or examples I might want to
  incorporate?
- Did you find the material presented today to be either too technical or too
  theoretical?
** Answer
- Does this approach seem like it could be useful on projects you've worked on?
- What else about code do you think might be visualizable?
- Would you be interested in the VR look of any particular library?
- Can you think of languages that wouldn't be well represented by this?
- Is there anything that helps you learn a code base that the demos should show?
