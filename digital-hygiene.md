# Digital hygiene

Recent research -has shown that you have a limited quantity of the most crucial
resource: your attention. Yet as a developer, your attention is often pulled in
a hundred different directions. In this talk, we will establish the importance
of minimizing your focus as much as possible and how it can boost the quality of
your work. We'll go through tricks I've learned to avoid letting distractions
get the best of me, ranging from the technical (like using custom notifications
to alert when a CI build is finished) to the everyday (like journaling during
programming). This talk will combine modern psychology, tech, and practicality.
By the end, developers will be better able to identify sources of distraction in
their work and find strategies to combat them.
