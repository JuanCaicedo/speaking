# speaking

This repo is a collection of submissions, ideas and talks for conferences.

As I've been trying to get better at techincal speaking and get my first talk
accepted to a conference, I often think about how great it would be to be able
to see other speaker's submissions, notes and talks. I figured why not be the
first, maybe some great speakers will end up doing it too!

# Thanks

I've had a huge amount of help getting started from Jordan Kasper
([@jakerella](https://github.com/jakerella/)), who offered to mentored me just
because he wanted to encourage more people to get into technical speaking.
Couldn't be more thankful! If you ever get a chance to show him some love, you
should.

# Stealth-caching: showing our most expensive feature to 10m users

How do you show the results of a complicated query (that may not have results)
while still keeping fast load times? This was a problem we faced at
SpanishDict.com when we rolled out our example sentences feature to our 10
million unique monthly visitors. In this talk, I will talk through our solution
that leverages client-side rendering for improved performance and caching
through Redis for improved user experience.

# Stealth-caching: como mostrarle el feature más costoso a todos los usuarios

Cómo se hace para poder mostrarle el resultado de un query complicado (el cual
podría no tener resultados) manteniendo un tiempo de carga corto? Éste fue el
problema que tuvimos en SpanishDict.com cuando queríamos mostrarle nuestras
frases de ejemplos a todos nuestros 10 millones de usuarios mensuales. En esta
charla, explicaré nuestra solución que utiliza rendering desde el cliente para
mejorar el rendimiento y caching con Redis para mejorar la experiencia del
usuario.
