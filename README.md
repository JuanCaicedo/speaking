# speaking

This repo is a collection of submissions, ideas and talks for conferences.

As I've been trying to get better at techincal speaking and get my first talk
accepted to a conference, I often think about how great it would be to be able
to see other speaker's submissions, notes and talks. I figured why not be the
first, maybe some great speakers will end up doing it too!

# Thanks

I've had a huge amount of help getting started from Jordan Kasper
([@jakerella](https://github.com/jakerella/)), who offered to mentored me just
because he wanted to encourage more people to get into technical speaking.
Couldn't be more thankful! If you ever get a chance to show him some love, you
should.
