* Abstract
Our brain evolved to understand physical space, but unfortunately code exists
mostly in the abstract. Virtual Reality creates a way to emulate physical
experiences through digital means. By visualizing code in VR, we can leverage
our spacial reasoning abilities to better understand code.
* Thoughts
- The idea I have here is that if we could visualize code like physical space,
  maybe we could understand it more
- I'm thinking that information like file size, file type, directory structure,
  would be interpreted differently if we map it to physical-ish concepts
- For example, each file is a shape, file size is its volume, file type is it's
  shape, last time it was edited is its color
- Or all directories are rooms and you can navigate between them
* Questions
** How do we do this in physical spaces
- How do we understand meaning or organization of rooms? Buildings?
- Maybe we could draw inspiration from civil engineering, industrial design,
  museum design, architecture
