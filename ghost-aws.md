Ghost brings simplicity, elegance and speed to blogging. Elastic Beanstalk brings easy deployment, scalability and efficiency to Amazon Web Services. This talk will show how SpanishDict brought zero-downtime to our Spanish and English blogs using both. Developers will learn how to run two blogs with a single code-base and how Fluencia reverse-engineered the Elastic Beanstalk deployment process to make it possible.
